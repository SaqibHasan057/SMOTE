This is a Python project where I used SMOTE algorithm and its variant Distance-SMOTE in order to oversample two popular machine learning datasets, PIMA Diabetes and Ionosphere, from UCI Machine Learning Repository.
These oversampled datasets are then trained upon using XGBoost algorithm to analyse the effect of algorithm based sample creation on dataset classification.
